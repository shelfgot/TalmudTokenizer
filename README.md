A project to test and develop various tokenization algorithms for tokenization of the Babylonian Talmud.
## More information
For more information on the theoretical background, development, and testing, please see the detailed write-up in `TalmudTokenizer_Thesis.pdf`.
## Warning
Research was done with limited resources (both computational and time.) Far more research is needed in order to establish results firmly and ensure near-perfect reprdocubility.
